How does the internet work?

        The internet is a request based system. Every function or protocol that runs is
    a request from one computer or network to another. This flow of information is across 
    the world. 
        The internet itself is a net within itself. A hub of connection that connects 
    the devices underneath it. 


What happens when you click on a link?
    https://www.google.com

        In the above link, the https is the communication protocol of the site. This one in particular
    encrypts the following link and ensures data security over the network.
        The www stands for World Wide Web. the www is where this information is being
    accessed from.
        The google portion is the Domain Name.
        The .com portion is the Top-level of the Domain.
        Any text that might follow .com ie .com/mail, .com/maps, etc. are pathways that are being requested

        The protocol is the method of accessing the www and going to the domain specified. From there the request follows
        the pathway dictated from the remaining elements of the URL.
